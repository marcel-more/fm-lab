-- Removed plug-in function calls (maintenance axis, plugin evidence).
-- Verbatim layer: reference/plugin_spec.duckdb (ATTACHed as 'plugref' by the
-- API connection; the fm-test direct path attaches it itself), derived from
-- the MBS docs mirror. status/removed_in are verbatim vendor statements
-- (plugin_functions.status = 'removed', removed_in extracted from the
-- "removed for MBS FileMaker Plugin Y" note).
-- Severity model: 'error' - unlike deprecated, a removed function no longer
-- exists in current plugin releases, the call fails at runtime. Unresolved
-- functions are surfaced by the deprecated sibling rule, never here: an
-- error row in this rule always means a real defect.
-- Maintenance axis only - no statement about runtime environments.
